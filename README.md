# 📋 Form Builder Application

## 🌟 Introduction

> **The Story Behind This Project**

Back in 2019, I revolutionized my father's business operations by creating an automated pipeline that transformed how he handled customer interactions. Using Google Forms as the foundation, I built a system that:

- 📝 **Collected customer feedback** through intuitive forms
- 🔄 **Automatically processed responses** into professional documents
- 📧 **Generated and sent quotations & contracts** directly to customers
- ⏰ **Saved countless hours** of manual document processing

This experience opened my eyes to the transformative power of well-designed form systems. **This repository represents my reimagination of what modern form building should be** - faster, smarter, and more accessible than ever before.

#### API Response Structure

**Form Responses API** (`/api/forms/[id]/responses`)

The responses API supports three different modes via query parameters:

1. **Default Mode** - Returns all responses:
```typescript
GET /api/forms/[id]/responses
// Returns: FormResponse[]
```

2. **Stats Mode** - Returns quick statistics:
```typescript
GET /api/forms/[id]/responses?action=stats
// Returns: { totalSubmissions: number, numberOfQuestions: number }
```

3. **Grouped Mode** - Returns responses grouped by questions:
```typescript
GET /api/forms/[id]/responses?action=grouped
// Returns: QuestionAnswers[]
```

**File Download API** (`/api/forms/download/[fileId]`)

Downloads files uploaded through form submissions:

```typescript
GET /api/forms/download/[fileId]
// Returns: File binary data with appropriate headers
// Headers include:
// - Content-Type: Original file MIME type
// - Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="original_filename"
// - Content-Length: File size in bytes
// - Cache-Control: private, max-age=3600
```

#### Data Models

**Form Structure:**
```typescript
interface Form {
  _id: string;
  title: string;
  description?: string;
  questions: Question[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

interface Question {
  id: string;
  type: 'short' | 'long' | 'radio' | 'checkbox' | 'file';
  label: string;
  isRequired: boolean;
  options?: string[]; // For radio/checkbox questions
}
```

**Response Structure:**
```typescript
interface FormResponse {
  _id: string;
  formId: string;
  answers: ResponseAnswer[] | Record<string, any>; // Supports both formats
  submittedAt: Date;
}

interface ResponseAnswer {
  questionId: string;
  questionType: string;
  value: string | string[] | FileUpload[];
}
```

#### Component Architecture
