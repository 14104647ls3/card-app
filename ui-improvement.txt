This is a project like google form.
There are 3 major route.
'/', /form/[id] and /form/[id]/edit.

Add a topbar ui to /components/ui, the topbar will be rendered on all pages which means it should be configed to be displayed in /src/app/layout.tsx
- At the left side of the top, there should be an icon of the system and the name of the system. Use a placeholder for the image and use the name 'Formify' as name
- At the center of the topbar, there should be 2 buttons, 'Froms' and 'Responses'; 'Forms' is equal to the route '/' part below the 'create new form' button. 'Responses' will be used later for route 'r   esponses'
- At the right side of the topbar, there will be a button of 'Create new form' which is the same button in '/'
